    <p> Budget Buddies was created during cmd-F 2024, and awarded the sponsor prize from MLH and Fidelity <i>Best DEI Hack</i>! The ongoing issue of financial illiteracy among adults, primarily due to inadequate education on the topic in schools is the inspiration behind our app. Our goal was to make learning about financial management both fun and accessible, so we designed Budget Buddies as a gamified mobile application. We created Budget Buddies on a React app but desigend the UI for a mobile app using taiwindCSS. We implemented a chatbot using Cohere&apos;s API, and a passwordless login with 1Password&apos;s Passage API. </p>
    <p> I was one fo the 2 developers on the team, and I was incharge of the implementation of Cohere&apos;s API as well as the text to speech tool. the other develoepr and I both worked on the front-end implementation together!</p>
