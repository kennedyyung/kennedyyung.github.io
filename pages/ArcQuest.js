     <p> Arc&apos;Quest is an omnichannel mobile application designed for Arc&apos;teryx to increase user activity and promote wellness. Our application incentivizes and facilitates outdoor activities, wellness practices, and eco-friendly behaviors, while maintaining the shopping aspect of Arc&apos;teryx&apos;s current application. Users can explore personalized recommendations for different trails, yoga classes, community events, and clothing from Arc&apos;teryx. Our reward system allows users to gain points for participating in activities and can redeem them for rewards or donations to environmental causes. Additionally, the app fosters community engagement, allowing users to connect with like-minded adventurers and share their outdoor experiences. </p>
     <p>We utilized Google Maps API for users to search any location to view nearby trails and OpenWeather API to retrieve the current weather at the location searched to better prepare users, and with the idea for further implementation of a database to use AI to suggest clothing from Arc&apos;teryx&apos;s catalog to purchase.</p>
    <p>I was one of the 2 developers on the team, and I implemented the Google Maps API as well as integrating the user interface into the app using React Native.</p>
